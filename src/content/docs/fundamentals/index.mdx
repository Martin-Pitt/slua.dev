## Development Environment
You can write SLua scripts in the script editor in the viewer.

:::caution[Experimental]
Currently you specifically need the [Second Life Project Lua Editor](https://releasenotes.secondlife.com/viewer.html) to be able to compile scripts to SLua.

Additionally only the regions at [SLua Beta Landing](https://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/SLua%20Beta%20Landing) and the beta grid currently support SLua.
:::

If you want to use an external editor, then you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Second Life External Scripting extension](https://github.com/secondlife/sl-vscode-plugin).
    - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is an alternative to VS Code if you prefer.


### Setting Up VS Code for SLua Scripting
1. Create a new workspace folder for your Second Life scripts
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Now back to your Second Life viewer, configure the *External Script Editor* setting in your preferences → Advanced → Script Development so that it opens up VS Code
    - On Windows this might look something like:
        ```
        "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" "%s"
        ```
4. Right-click on an object in Second Life
5. Select "Edit" → "Scripts"
6. Click "New Script" or "Edit" on existing script
7. Rename the script and create an equivalent file in your VS Code workspace but with the `.luau` extension
8. Click _Edit..._ on the script editor window - VS Code will automatically open, showing a temporary file for moment but then switching over to the equivalent file as the master script
9. Edit in VS Code with full preprocessing support
10. Save to sync changes back to the viewer
