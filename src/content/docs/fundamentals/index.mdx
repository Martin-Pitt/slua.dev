## Development Environment
You can write SLua scripts in the script editor in the viewer.

:::caution[Experimental]
Currently you specifically need the [Second Life Project Lua Editor](https://releasenotes.secondlife.com/viewer.html) to be able to compile scripts to SLua.

Additionally only the sandbox regions at [SLua Beta Landing](https://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/SLua%20Beta%20Landing) and the beta grid currently support SLua.

Note: The SLua Beta regions are Linden sandboxes, which means they [*delete* items](https://feedback.secondlife.com/server-bugs/p/auto-return-in-slua-beta-sandbox-regions-are-deleting-instead-of-returning-objec) after 8 hours are up (they do not return despite [what the knowledge base claims](https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/building-tips-r13/#sandboxes:~:text=Sandboxes%20usually%20have%20auto%20return)!). So make sure to backup / take copies of your work.
:::

If you want to use an external editor, then you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Second Life External Scripting extension](https://github.com/secondlife/sl-vscode-plugin).
    - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is an alternative to VS Code if you prefer.


### Setting Up VS Code for SLua Scripting
1. Create a new workspace folder for your Second Life scripts
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Now back to your Second Life viewer, configure the *External Script Editor* setting in your preferences → Advanced → Script Development so that it opens up VS Code
    - On Windows this might look something like:
        ```
        "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" "%s"
        ```
4. Right-click on an object in Second Life
5. Select "Edit" → "Scripts"
6. Click "New Script" or "Edit" on existing script
7. Rename the script and create an equivalent file in your VS Code workspace but with the `.luau` extension
8. Click _Edit..._ on the script editor window - VS Code will automatically open, showing a temporary file for moment but then switching over to the equivalent file as the master script
9. Edit in VS Code with full preprocessing support
10. Save to sync changes back to the viewer

:::danger[Folder Assocation Bug]
Name-based folder association is currently broken in the latest Second Life VS Code plugin (v1.0.3 currently).

This means that if you open a script from a folder that is not the root of your workspace, then the plugin will not be able to find the equivalent file in your workspace.

See the github issue: [sl-vscode-plugin/issues/49](https://github.com/secondlife/sl-vscode-plugin/issues/49)

Workarounds are to to drop down to v1.0.2 or to use the new `--@file` syntax to specify the path inside the files:
1. Enable the `--@file` directive syntax in the plugin settings, search for `slVscodeEdit.sync.useFileMetaForMatching`
2. Specify the directly and name file via `--@file`, for example `--@file test/foo.luau`
    - You need to add the `--@file` line at the top of the file in both the in-world script and the VS Code file
3. Now when you open the script via `Edit...` in the viewer it should open the correct file in VS Code and sync the files
