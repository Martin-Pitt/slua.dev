> Cover luau and slua libraries here
> 
> Start with the easiest libraries to document: math, string, table, os, etc.
> 
> Then move onto ll.* functions and what you can do in Second Life (per categories)
> 
> Finally mention advanced functions from the easier libraries and move onto advanced libarries like bit32, utf8, buffer, coroutines, etc.
> 
> However mind that this is not a reference, so be light on details, focus on good explanations, remember: “Assume that anyone you're teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence.”
