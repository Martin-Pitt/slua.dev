## Arrays
Tables can be used as arrays:
```slua
local example = {1,2,3,4}
```

Iterating an array:
```slua
for index, value in example do
    print(index, value)
end
```

## Dictionary
Tables can be used as dictionaries / maps:
```slua
local example = {key1 = "value1", key2 = "value2"}
```

Iterating a dictionary:
```slua
for key, value in example do
    print(key, value)
end
```
