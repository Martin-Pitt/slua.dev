:::danger[Upcoming]
`vector.lerp` is upstream in Luau but not yet merged into SLua.

Last checked: _Luau 2025-12-04.19944688578_

For now you can calculate lerp manually: `a + (b - a) * t`

:::tip[Fastcall Mechanism]
The vector functions can benefit from optimisation via [Luau's fastcall mechanism](https://luau.org/performance#specialized-builtin-function-calls). However the function call needs to be 'obvious' to the compiler, so avoid calling them via colon syntax or through indirect function calls.

Currently fastcall functions in `vector` include all except for `vector.angle`
