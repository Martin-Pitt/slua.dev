> Honestly the current pathfinding system needs an overhaul and has important gotchas.
> 
> 'Characters' in the pathfinding feature are very limited in their movement and physics.
> 
> Navmesh pathfinding is the way to go though and the valuable part of it, so perhaps recommending a setup via `ll.GetStaticPath`
> 
> So we might just go over: recommended setup > alternatives > characters as LL intended
>
> Alternatively we can also recommend A* pathfinding or other higher quality algorithms.
> 
> Scripters might also want to work with a grid rather than free space depending on their usecase.
> So we might want to think about betters ways to structure this around usecase/approach rather than just purely the current LL pathfinding system / functions.
> Can use opensource libraries, guides and recipes to cover stuff.
