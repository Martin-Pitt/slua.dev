Data transmission is the art of serialising and deserialising data for storage or transmission.

This often involves converting complex data structures into strings that can be easily transmitted or stored in chat messages, linkset data, notecards, prim descriptions, or transmitted over HTTP.

:::tip[Recommended]
Use [`lljson.slencode`](../reference/standard-library/lljson.mdx) and [`lljson.sldecode`](../reference/standard-library/lljson.mdx) for most of your data serialisation needs, as they provide a robust and efficient way to handle complex data structures.
