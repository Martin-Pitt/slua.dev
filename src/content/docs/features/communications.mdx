## Owner say / print
[`ll.OwnerSay`](../../reference/standard-library/ll#OwnerSay) (aliased by [`print`](../../reference/standard-library/global#print)) is the simplest way for a script to communicate with the owner of the object directly.

This is pretty much your most common way to output what is going on inside your script, for debugging, information, or interaction purposes.

It stands out from other types of object chat and has no throttling limit.

## Link Messages
Link messages are an easy way to communicate between scripts in the same object.

You use [`ll.MessageLinked`](../../reference/standard-library/ll#MessageLinked) to send messages and the [`link_message`](../../reference/events#link_message) event to receive them.

With one link message you can send across a number and two strings. From the [`link_message`](../../reference/events#link_message) event you can also tell the link number of the script that sent the message from.


## Linkset Data
Linkset data is a way to store a lot of data in an object permanently and have it accessible to all scripts in the object. The amount of data you can store is up to 128KB and is stored in a key-value format as strings.

This can be used to passively share data between scripts.

There is also a [`linkset_data`](../../reference/events#linkset_data) event that can be used to monitor changes to linkset data, however it should be used with caution as it can be triggered very frequently depending how active your script is with linkset data.

Linkset data can be used many ways, from storing user settings to a clever way to slowly process through a queue of data.

:::tip[Performance]
It is recommended to use a strategy of storing data across many keys rather than one big blob of data as this cuts down the performance cost of reading and writing data.
