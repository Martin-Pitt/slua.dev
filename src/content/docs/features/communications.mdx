## Owner say / print
> Using `ll.OwnerSay`/`print` to communicate with the owner directly; This is the 101 of scripting, very important! — Nexii


## Listeners
> Write about listeners, channels, ll.Say and variants — Nexii
### Channels
### Sending Messages


## Link Messages
> Link messages for communication between linked prims / scripts in the same linkset object — Nexii


## Linkset Data
> Linkset Data can be used to communicate between scripts passively/async (settings/data/queues via `ll.LinksetDataRead`) or even actively in certain cases (`linkset_data` event) — Nexii


## HTTP Requests
> How to do a HTTP request to an external web server, or even another object (Web Server below) — Nexii


## Web Server (HTTP-in)
> Having it explained as a web server will be more useful to learners than 'HTTP-in' or 'HTTP responses' which are a bit confusing or vague and sound more like the advanced functionality that it is but also approachable with this mental model — Nexii
